[00:31.73] Hello
[00:34.43] I've waited here for you
[00:38.64] Everlong
[00:42.47] Tonight
[00:44.85] I throw myself into
[00:49.29] And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
[01:11.79] 
[01:03.68] Come down
[01:06.13] And waste away with me
[01:10.56] Down with me
[01:14.10] Slow how
[01:17.07] You wanted it to be
[01:21.08] I'm over my head, out of her head she sang
[01:28.91] And I wonder, when I sing along with you
[01:37.37] If everything could ever feel this real forever
[01:43.30] If anything could ever be this good again
[01:49.45] The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[01:52.54] You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
[01:57.35] She sang
[02:01.35] 
[02:09.07] Breathe out
[02:11.57] So I can breathe you in
[02:15.74] Hold you in
[02:19.78] And now
[02:22.27] I know you've always been there
[02:26.49] Out of your head, out of my head I sang
[02:45.99] 
[02:34.33] And I wonder, when I sing along with you
[02:42.64] If everything could ever feel this real forever
[02:48.78] If anything could ever be this good again
[02:54.86] The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[02:57.92] You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
[03:02.87] She sang
[03:06.87] 
[03:30.12] And I wonder
[03:34.16] If everything could ever feel this real forever
[03:39.90] If anything could ever be this good again
[03:46.57] The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[03:49.63] You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
