[00:31.66] Hello
[00:34.33] I've waited here for you
[00:38.45] Everlong
[00:42.45] 
[00:42.44] Tonight, I throw myself into
[00:48.92] And out of the red
[00:50.61] Out of her head, she sang
[01:03.11] 
[01:03.59] Come down and waste away with me
[01:10.41] Down with me
[01:14.22] Slow, how you wanted it to be
[01:21.03] I'm over my head
[01:22.73] Out of her head, she sang
[01:35.23] 
[01:29.07] And I wonder
[01:33.11] When I sing along with you
[01:46.11] 
[01:37.38] If everything could ever be this real forever
[01:43.34] If anything could ever be this good again
[01:49.59] The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[01:52.54] You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
[01:57.50] She sang
[02:01.50] 
[02:09.10] Breathe out
[02:11.57] So I can breathe you in
[02:15.89] Hold you in
[02:19.83] And now
[02:22.21] I know you've always been
[02:26.56] Out of your head
[02:27.87] Out of my head, I sang
[02:38.87] 
[02:34.15] And I wonder
[02:38.40] When I sing along with you
[02:51.40] 
[02:42.52] If everything could ever feel this real forever
[02:48.62] If anything could ever be this good again
[02:54.81] The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[02:57.81] You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
[03:02.71] She sang
[03:06.71] 
[03:30.15] And I wonder
[03:36.15] 
[03:34.66] If everything could ever feel this real forever
[03:40.19] If anything could ever be this good again
[03:46.47] The only thing I'll ever ask of you
[03:49.49] You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
